# water_plant

An app that will help you to water your plants!

## Overview Screen
Here you can see an overview of your tanks, each presented in a modern, compact way. Each tank card displays the tanks' water level, and the connected plants that need watering. 
Clicking on a tank card will show a new screen with further information about the tank and the plants belonging to it. There is also an option to edit the tank, here you can edit the device name, edit which internet the device is connected to, or delete the device altogether.
Clicking on one of the plants connected to the tank will go to a new screen that shows information about the plant, such as its name, picture, current soil moisture, the device it's connected to, the tanks' current water level, and a checkbox that can turn on and off automatic watering for the plant. There is also a button that the user can press to tell the device to water the plant, or stop the device from watering the plant if it's already watering it.
In the top right corner there is an edit button, similar to the edit button for the tank, which one can use to edit the plant name, the pipe its connected to, the type of plant it is, and its picture. Here you can also remove it from the tank by deleting it.

In the plant screen, there is also an information button that one can press, which will show a page that contains information about the plant type, similar to a condensed Wikipedia lookup of that plant type. Here one can see information such as the ideal soil moisture, placement and watering habit for that type of plant, as well as a picture of that type of plant.
